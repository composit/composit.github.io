Summary
Over ten years experience developing web applications, mostly in Ruby on Rails, Javascript (Backbone/
Angular/Ember), and some Go. Future development interests include more Ruby, while excited about
 possibilities with Elixir/ Phoenix and Go (Clojure? Scala?), which I have been exploring through toy
 projects. Work experience including server/application monitoring applications, e-commerce, inventory and
 project information management. Advanced degree in Management Information Systems. Code-community
 involvement includes starting and running Fort Collins Ruby Group for five years. Strength in communicating
 technical information to non-technical users. Coding style: collaborative, clean, behavior-driven, with test
 coverage.
